        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Dry Pancake Mix</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 oz all purpose flour (~2 cups)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>For Each Batch of Pancakes:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk (~12 flozs)</li>
                    <li>1 cup sour cream (~8 flozs)</li>
                    <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li><em>Warm maple syrup</em></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><storng>For the Dry Pancake Mix:</storng> Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until homogenous. Transfer to an airtight container. The mix will stay good for 3 months.</li>
            <li><strong>For each Batch of Pancakes:</strong> Place one batch of dry mix in a large bowl. In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogenous. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking. Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps). </li>
            <li>Heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Use a 1‚ÅÑ4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter.</li>
